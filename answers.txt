1. You have to create a Gemfile to access Rspec. Then you have to run "bundle install" in your terminal.
Then you have to initialize Rspec with "rspec --init" 
Finally you have to pass in the following to the .rspec file

--format documentation
--color

2. Writing the tests first are a way of knowing what you are doing and why,
not just coding away aimlessly.
